            As demonstrated in this chapter, the value of youth participation is now recognized at levels ranging from 
the local community to the international arena. However, recognition is not the same as action, and progress 
in the area of practical implementation has been slow. Even in those countries that have achieved the most, 
participation remains piecemeal and insufficiently integrated into all areas of young people’s lives.Many 
organizations are still unconvinced that youth can play a leading or supportive role in helping them achieve 
their programme goals. Initiatives may be limited to seeking the views of young people on particular issues; 
their involvement in decision-making is rarely sought. Young people therefore remain marginal to most 
democratic processes. Token participation is meaningless, as it does not empower young people to influence 
outcomes and achieve real change. The frequent and widespread failure of the adult world to act in ways that 
promote the welfare of young people is well documented. Efforts must be made to listen to youth and engage 
them in the process of strengthening participatory democracy. Their involvement can lead to better decisions 
and outcomes. Participation promotes the well-being and development of young people, strengthens their 
commitment to and understanding of human rights and democracy, and provides them a form of protection; 
it also allows them to take part in decision-making processes. Youth participation is an essential strategy for 
ensuring young people’s optimal development—and for achieving wider development goals for society. The 
progress made to date in promoting participation should be sustained and enhanced. Youth participation 
must become an integral component of, local, national and international policies for youth, and should 
provide the framework for decisions and actions that affect the daily lives of children and young people. 
Only then will the traditional approaches towards youth begin to evolve and the oft-stated commitment to 
their participation begin to have meaning. The approach must promote respect for them as social actors, as 
agents in their own lives, and as citizens of their own societies.

            With the release of USAID’s Youth in Development Policy, a great amount of energy and momentum exists 
around including youth across development programs. Several ways to increase youth participation were 
outlined in this brief – from supporting youth-led organizations to connecting with youth through youth 
advisory councils. While all of the different options have merit and have worked in other organizations, the 
most important thing is to ensure that the intention behind engaging youth is genuine and clear. Those taking 
a leadership role in increasing youth participation within an organization should have solid goals and 
objectives, and understand their organization’s capacity to implement such an initiative. Resources, 
including staff time to manage and coordinate efforts are crucial. In addition, young people should be 
offered meaningful roles and be empowered to take some ownership of any activities with which they are 
involved. Special caution is also needed with regard to managing young people’s expectations of the roles 
they can play and contributions they can make to an organization’s programs, practices and operations. 
Finally, young people should be supported through training, mentorship, and guidance from development 
experts. Without these things in place youth engagement runs the risk of being tokenistic and creating 
distrust and dissolution among youth. A truly dedicated youth engagement effort has the potential to 
improve program effectiveness and relevance, foster innovative ideas, create mutigenerational solutions to 
development problems, and create the next generation of strong development professionals.
Addresing the youth at the right time can decrease these problems by facilating their adoption these 
problems by facilating their adoption of healthy behavoir.Main purpose of introducing the subject at college 
level is helping the youth to ensure a healthy transition into adulthood and understanding the role of 
psychological and social changes in relation to their various experiences
