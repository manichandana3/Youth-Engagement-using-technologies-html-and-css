<h1>PRATICAL STRATEGIES</h1>
<h3>
1.Building partnerships</h3>
<p>Building partnerships with youth is essential to the success of any youth engagement efforts. It’s important 
that adults are willing to form meaningful connections with youth and establish trusting relationships. Youth 
Engagement Champions can play a crucial role in building trusting relationship built on respect. Strong adult 
allies can provide incentive for youth to get involved and stay involved with organizations</p>
<br><h3>2.Building Capacity</h3>
<p>One of the major benefits of youth engagement is that it provides opportunities for youth to learn and 
grow. By involving young people in the work of the organization, they will naturally encounter many 
opportunities to develop new skills as they take on new responsibilities, work on new tasks, and collaborate 
with others. There are also ways to promote learning and development by purposefully providing 
opportunities for youth to learn new skills, as well as by using teachable moments to facilitate development. 
Organizations should consciously foster development and growth by providing opportunities to youth in one 
or more of the following ways</p>
<li> Provide opportunities for growth.</li>
<li> Provide Leadership opportunities.</li>
<li> Identify teachable Moments.</li>
<br>
<h4>
Provide opportunities for Growth</h4>
<li>Support youth to work on tasks that will build a particular skill</li>
<li>Offer workshops that interest youth (ie. Cultural awareness, conflict resolution, etc.)</li>
<li>Attend conferences</li>
<li>Offer training days (ie. Facilitations training,research and evaluation methods)</li>
<li>Support youth to earn certificates (First Aid,etc.)</li><br></ul>
<br>
<h4>
Provide leadership opportunities</h4>
<li>Allow youth to identify issues that are important to them</li>
<li>Youth can facilitate meetings</li>
<li>Youth can lead projects</li>
<li>Encourage youth to present the results of small group activities back to the larger group</li>
<li>Youth can present at conferences, to the organization or community</li>
<li>real decision-making power to youth</li><br>
<h4>
Identify teachable moments</h4>
<p>Teachable moments arise naturally when practicing youth engagement. A teachable moment is an 
opportunity to identify, encourage and acknowledge behaviors that lead to positive changes to the individual 
and, as a result, to a group as a whole. Teachable moments are unplanned and arise when you see an 
opportunity to expand upon an issue or a topic that participants are engaged in right that moment. Teachable 
moments may require a bit of a digression to explore the topic, but they offer an excellent opportunity for 
development since youth are already engaged and interested in the topic. For example, when youth are asked 
to give a presentation to the community, a teachable moment exists to learn about public speaking and 
presentation techniques. Or if an adult expresses that she is unhappy with a decision made, a teachable 
moment exists to respectfully explore differing viewpoints.</p>
<br>
<h3>3.Be flexible</font></h3>
<p>All groups change and shift over time particularly as new members come and go or as youth engagement 
efforts go through various stages. When adults mirror flexibility and the ability to adapt to these changes it 
can be contagious. Communicating disappointment and excitement during the process also models how to 
work through change, removing the anxiety that it may cause for some people.</p>
Methods of managing change include:
<li> Revisit the group’s ground rules (particularly when new members join).</li>
<li> Review the purpose of youth engagement activities and the vision for these activities within the 
organization.</li>
<li> Create a mentorship role for longstanding members to help new members transition into the group.</li>
<li>  Celebrate the planned move of a member from the group.</li>
<li> Share feelings about the changes or the changing dynamic in the group.</li>
<li> Make yourself available for youth to speak openly and freely one to one about changes.</li>
<br>
<h3>4.Limit down time</h3>
<p>Young people are likely to remain actively and meaningfully engaged when they are contributing ideas that 
guide the work and are given the choice of how best to lend their skills to a project. Try to keep the 
momentum and maintain regular contact with involved youth. If members continuously feel they are making 
progress on a project and believe this project will make a difference to youth in the future, it is more likely 
that the group will remain strong and connected. </p>
<p> periods of down time, youth value ongoing personal contact or notification of other opportunities to 
remain connected and engaged. It can be as simple as making a phone call, sending an email, or sending a 
message on a social media site like Facebook just to check in. When this does not occur, young people may 
feel that relationships feel more transactional and limited rather than personal and meaningful.</p>
<br>
<h3>5.Communicating with youth</h3>
<p>Different generations have different ways of communicating. Working in partnership with youth requires 
awareness of the ways people in different age groups communicate. Awareness of these differences can help 
organizations reach out to youth, improve communication, and keep them engaged. Always consider the 
medium, style, content, speed and frequency of information you share with youth.</p>
<br>Here are some key points to consider when communicating with them:
 <li>Provide shorter, more frequent updates. If possible find ways of delivering real time messages.</li>
 <li>Create authentic communications. Being authentic means more than telling the truth, it means answering 
the question “why do they care?” in down to earth language and being transparent.</li>
<li>Turn youth into change agents. Youth want to make tangible contributions and are willing to spend their 
available time if they feel they can make an impact. If they are properly engaged, they will become your 
biggest advocates and virally spread the messages and news.</li>
<li>Develop mechanisms to generate great ideas. Ask the question “How can fresh ideas from youth be 
identified?” “How can we leverage these broad thinkers and capitalize on their insights?” Youth need to be 
invited into and valued as members of our community.</li>
<li>Make sure the message is relevant to the lifestyle of youths and that the media used is one that resonates 
with them.</li>
<li>Consider your audience and take into account youths’ attitudes, opinions, knowledge and behaviours.
    <li>Develop multimedia communication campaigns that incorporate words, music, and images in the 
messaging.</li>
<li> Ask youth what ideas they have before creating your communication campaign.</li>
<li>Address the multicultural diversity of the youth market paying close attention to the communities and 
<li> social media to reach youths and to encourage them to share your messages.</li>
<li>Usemedia to reach youths and to encourage them to share your messages.</li>
