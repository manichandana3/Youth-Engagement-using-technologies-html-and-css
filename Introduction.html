WHAT IS YOUTH ENGAGEMENT </font>
<br><br>
<font size="4"><b>The Centre of Excellence for Youth Engagement defines youth engagement as the sustained and 
meaningful involvement of a young person in an activity focussed outside of themselves.10 A closer look 
at this definition provides important hints for effective activities and practices:
<br><br><font color="red">1. Sustained:</font> Youth engagement that endures over time leads to positive outcomes. However, short and 
intense engagement experiences can also be effective if they satisfy the rest of the definition. Intense 
experiences often motivate sustained ones. 
<br><br><font color="red">2. Meaningful:</font>The engagement activities and topics are relevant to young people – this can be assured if 
youth are asked to contribute to the development of the engagement activity.
<br><br><font color="red">3. A focus outside the self:</font>Youth are engaged when they feel connected and/or are contributing to 
something larger than themselves. 
<br><br>Full engagement consists of Head, Heart, Feet and Spirit components:
<br><br>a. Head: a cognitive component, e.g., learning new things
<br>b. Heart: an affective component, e.g., feeling excited 
<br>c. Feet: a behavioural component, e.g., spending time doing an activity 
<br>d. Spirit: a spirit sked to contribute to the development of the engagement activity.
<br><br>Participation is the simple act of showing up; engagement occurs when head, heart, feet and spirit are 
involved. Engagement is a process that is dynamic, reciprocal and interactive, like a relationship. And just as 
every relationship is unique, there is no single right way to engage youth.

<br><br>It’s simple. Youth engagement (YE) can and does change lives. This eBook is designed to give you 
insight into the “how” and “why” of YE, as well as the outcomes you can expect. Youth engagement 
recognizes young people’s right to participate in decisions that impact them and acknowledges the great
skills and strengths they bring to the table. It injects young people as valued stakeholders into creating 
effective and inclusive policies, programs and environments.
<br><br>Effective youth engagement leads to positive outcomes for young people at three levels:
<br>1. The Individual level: e.g. increased personal skills, healthy choices, and sense of identity.
<br>2. The social level: e.g. stronger positive connections with friends and adults, and a larger support 
network. 
<br>3. The system level: e.g. greater civic engagement, policies and programs responsive to the needs of 
young people, and new creative ways to govern.</font>
