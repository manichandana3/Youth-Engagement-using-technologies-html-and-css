<h1>THE MOTIVATION INITIATING YOUTH ENGAGEMENT</h1>
<br>
<p><b>
   Youths are the backbone of a community. They are the promising dreamers possessing incredible potentials that could be transformed into a tangible accomplishment. Encouraging them with constructive motivation can extend hope and could illuminate their future outlook towards the world.</p></b>
<li>However, most young people are prone to get demotivated these days due to mental pressures relating to society, academic and personal issues etc. Younger folks can easily be entangled within fears that can shatter their future. This is one of the main reasons behind the youth not being sometimes bold enough to take on new ventures.</li>
<li>Keeping the present scenario in mind, it is important to understand that motivation serves as a universal force for self-realization, and it is considered as one of the most essential factors for achieving a successful life for an individual. Motivation is also one of the key elements for igniting self-determination and self-belief. Enabling youngsters to recognize failure as a lesson instead of a setback is extremely important. Life itself is vibrant and constantly changing, and comes with its unpredictability. Acknowledging failure as one of the means for change and success could encourage youth to learn from their own mistakes and stand on their own feet.</li>
<li>Unemployment plagues a country’s growth. Most of the unemployed population are dealing with crisis due to lack of inspiration, motivation and ambition, unsatisfied salaries, disinterested jobs, wrong career path, family pressures etc.</li>
<li>In today‘s world, many young adults are not ready to put in the amount of hard work it takes to succeed in life. More and more teens and young adults with great potential are performing relatively little to tap into their abilities and talents. Rather than persevering to hold on to their ambitions, a section of the young population may never aspire or attempt to reach their true potential without self-belief and motivation. When young adults are not motivated, they may get caught into an entanglement of negativity, low self-esteem, lack of hope and no drive to succeed. Youngsters that are not motivated can plunge into a life of apathy.</li>
