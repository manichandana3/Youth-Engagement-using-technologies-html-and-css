<h2>LESSONS LEARNED AND FUTURE CHALLENGES</h2>
<p>The practice of creating meaningful opportunities for young people to participate as active agents in 
decisions affecting them is relatively new in most countries, and in most arenas of young people’s lives. This 
is a rapidly growing and evolving field in which there is little history or prior experience to draw on and 
much experimental and innovative work being developed. There has been a steep learning curve both for 
adults struggling to create such opportunities for youth and for young people themselves as they grapple 
with the construction of new forms of negotiation and dialogue with adults. The past decade has been 
witness to a multitude of developments and efforts aimed at securing greater respect for young people’s 
participatory rights; however, much more needs to be done before the commitments to participation 
embodied in the World Programme of Action for Youth to the Year 2000 and Beyond are translated into 
practice for the majority for young people. Presumptions of young people’s incompetence and lack of 
legitimacy in arenas traditionally occupied exclusively by adults continue to prevail. Respect for young 
people as social actors, as citizens or as active participants in decisions and processes affecting their own 
lives is far from universal. The rights of many young people continue to be violated with relative impunity 
throughout the world, while the opportunities they have to challenge those violations remain limited. There 
is a need to undertake a critical analysis not only of the progress made to date, but also of the continuing 
barriers that must be addressed if commitments to youth participation are to be universally fulfilled.</p>
